# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Tseten Lama, the client, is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. He has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment he is tracking all his transactions using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Tseten Lama to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Tseten Lama is in need of a digital ledger that helps him track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics.
There is no existing product that meets the needs of Tseten, so he needs someone to develop a product that is specifically made for the purposes listed above for him to make his life easier. 
The developer, Yuxuan Tao, agrees to develop a product that satisfies these needs and fulfills the requirements, allowing the client to organize and keep track of his spendings and the statistics about the currency of his choice. 
Apart from these requirements, Tseten Lama is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.
