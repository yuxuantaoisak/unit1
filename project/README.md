# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Tseten Lama, the client, is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. He has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment he is tracking all his transactions using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Tseten Lama to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Tseten Lama is in need of a digital ledger that helps him track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics.

There is no existing product that meets the needs of Tseten, so he needs someone to develop a product that is specifically made for the purposes listed above for him to make his life easier. 

The developer, Yuxuan Tao, agrees to develop a product that satisfies these needs and fulfills the requirements, allowing the client to organize and keep track of his spendings and the statistics about the currency of his choice. 

Apart from these requirements, Tseten Lama is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed solution

Design statement: I will design and make an **electronic ledger** for a client who is **Tseten Lama**. The **electronic ledger** will be **a software that helps the client to withdraw and transfer money and track spendings** and is constructed using the software **PyCharm**. It will take **four weeks** to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria **A, B, and C**.

Introduction to the cryptocurrency:
Monero (XMR) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was created in 2014. It is designed to provide enhanced privacy and anonymity for its users compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Monero achieves this privacy through various cryptographic techniques, including Stealth Addresses, Ring Signature, and Ring CT. This ensures that the sender, the receiver and the amount of transaction are all hidden by default.
